## ♻ About

It is well-known that CO2 emissions contribute to global warming and climate change, which can significantly cause severe impacts and consequences for humans and the environment. With this virtual experience you can revive some common situations of everyday life in a domestic environment to understand how your actions can have an impact on CO2 emissions.

Piedino, our little green friend, will give you some information about CO2 emissions everytime you complete a task. At the end of the experience, you’ll get a score and a little report that will inform you on every little thing you can change in your everyday life to reduce your Carbon Footprint.
